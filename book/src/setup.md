# Setup

> **FRIEND:** Did you check if our guest has already packed for our trip?

Oops.

Before we go, make sure that you have <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">Rust installed</a> on your machine.

Then, start by creating a new project in your preferred directory using `cargo`, Rust's package manager.

```text
> cargo new --lib chess
> cd chess
```

> **FRIEND:** Wait hold on. Do they know what `cargo` even is?

To be honest, I'm not even sure what `cargo` is.

> **FRIEND:** Installing Rust from the link above installs the language as well as three important parts of the Rust toolchain: `rustc`, `rustup`, and `cargo`.

What do those three things do?

> **FRIEND:** `rustc` is the Rust's compiler, `rustup` is the installer for Rust and its tools, and `cargo` is Rust's package manager. Once you run the commands given above, you've created a project named "chess" that is managed by `cargo`.

Gotcha. Now we're ready to go?

> **FRIEND:** Ready if you two are.
